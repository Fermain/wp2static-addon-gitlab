- GitLab Project Access Token with `api` scope (recommended) or Personal Access Token with `api` and `write_repository` scopes

## Installation

1. **Download/Clone** this add-on to your WordPress plugins directory:
   ```
   wp-content/plugins/wp2static-addon-gitlab-private/
   ```

2. **Activate** the plugin in WordPress Admin ‚Üí Plugins

3. **Configure** the add-on in WP2Static ‚Üí GitLab Private

4. **Enable** the add-on in WP2Static ‚Üí Add-ons

## Configuration

### 1. Create GitLab Access Token (Project Access Token Recommended)

**Option A: Project Access Token (Recommended)**
1. Go to your target GitLab repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Access Tokens
2. Create a new token with:
   - `api` scope - Access the authenticated user's API  
   - `Maintainer` or `Owner` role
3. Set an appropriate expiration date
4. Save the token securely

**Option B: Personal Access Token (Alternative)**
1. Go to your GitLab instance ‚Üí User Settings ‚Üí Access Tokens
2. Create a new token with these scopes:
   - `api` - Access the authenticated user's API
   - `write_repository` - Write (push) to repository
3. Set an appropriate expiration date
4. Save the token securely

### 2. Find Your Project ID

1. Navigate to your target GitLab repository
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí General
3. The Project ID is displayed at the top of the page
4. Copy this number (e.g., `12345`)

### 3. Configure the Add-on

Navigate to **WP2Static ‚Üí GitLab Private** and fill in:

- **GitLab URL**: Your GitLab instance URL
  - GitLab.com: `https://gitlab.com`
  - Self-hosted: `https://gitlab.yourcompany.com`
- **Project ID**: The numeric project ID from step 2
- **Access Token**: The personal access token from step 1
- **Working Branch**: The branch to push deployments to (e.g., `staging`)
- **Target Branch**: Where merge requests will target (e.g., `master`)
  - MRs are created automatically when the working branch is new
- **Deploy Subdirectory**: Subdirectory within the repo to receive the site (default: `public`)
- **Commit Message**: Message for deployment commits
- **Author Name & Email**: Git commit author information

### 4. Test Connection

Click **Test Connection** to verify your configuration. You should see:
```
Connection successful! Project: your-project-name
```

### 5. Enable in WP2Static

1. Go to **WP2Static ‚Üí Add-ons**
2. Find "GitLab Private" and click **Enabled**
3. The add-on is now active for deployments

## Usage

### Automatic Deployment

Once configured, the add-on will automatically deploy when you:

1. Run a full workflow: **WP2Static ‚Üí Run**
2. Process the job queue that includes a deploy job
3. Use WP-CLI: `wp wp2static deploy`

### Manual Deployment

You can also trigger deployment manually via WP-CLI:

```bash
# Full workflow (detect, crawl, post-process, deploy)
wp wp2static full_workflow

# Deploy only (requires processed site)
wp wp2static deploy
```

## How It Works

### When Working Branch Doesn't Exist (First Deployment)

1. **File Processing**: WP2Static generates static files in `wp-content/uploads/wp2static-processed-site/`
2. **Repo Checkout**: The add-on shallow clones the repository
3. **Branch Creation**: Creates the working branch from the target branch
4. **Scoped Sync**: Copies the processed site into the configured deploy subdirectory (default `public/`)
   - Optional: If "Delete Orphaned Files" is enabled, the deploy subdirectory is cleaned before copy
5. **Git Commit & Push**: Commits changes and pushes to the working branch with GitLab push options:
   - Creates a merge request targeting the target branch
   - Sets auto-merge when CI/CD pipeline succeeds
   - Automatically removes the working branch after merge
6. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitLab runs the pipeline on the MR; if it passes, the MR auto-merges
7. **Deployment**: Your pipeline can deploy the merged changes to production

### When Working Branch Exists (Subsequent Deployments)

1. **File Processing**: WP2Static generates static files
2. **Repo Checkout**: Shallow clones and checks out the existing working branch
3. **Scoped Sync**: Updates files in the deploy subdirectory
4. **Git Commit & Push**: Commits changes and pushes with `--force-with-lease`
   - Updates the existing branch
   - If an MR is open, GitLab automatically updates it with the new commits
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Pipeline runs again; MR auto-merges when successful

### Example Workflow

**Configuration:**
- Working Branch: `staging`
- Target Branch: `master`

**First deployment:**
- Creates `staging` from `master` ‚Üí Pushes ‚Üí Creates MR ‚Üí CI passes ‚Üí Auto-merges ‚Üí Branch deleted

**Second deployment (after branch deleted):**
- Creates `staging` from `master` again ‚Üí New MR created ‚Üí Process repeats

**OR if you want to iterate before merging:**
- Don't let the MR merge (disable auto-merge temporarily)
- Second deployment updates `staging` ‚Üí Updates existing MR
- Third deployment updates `staging` again ‚Üí MR updates again
- When ready, enable auto-merge and let pipeline complete

## Git Operations

The add-on performs standard git operations server-side:

- Shallow clone via HTTPS with token credential embedding
- Ensure committer name/email are set locally
- Create or fast-forward the target branch
- Copy site output into the deploy subdirectory
- `git add -A`, `git commit` (no-op if nothing changed), and `git push`

## Kubernetes Deployment

This add-on is specifically designed for Kubernetes environments:

### Advantages
- ‚úÖ **No Git Installation Required** - Uses API calls instead of git commands
- ‚úÖ **Minimal Dependencies** - Only requires WordPress and cURL
- ‚úÖ **Outbound Only** - No inbound network access needed
- ‚úÖ **Stateless** - No local git repositories or SSH keys to manage

### Example Kubernetes Workflow

```yaml
# WordPress Pod (internal)
WordPress + WP2Static + GitLab Add-on
    ‚Üì (HTTPS API calls)
GitLab Repository
    ‚Üì (GitLab CI/CD)
Production Deployment
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Test Fails

**"Connection failed (HTTP 401)"**
- Check your access token is correct and not expired
- Verify token has `api` and `write_repository` scopes

**"Connection failed (HTTP 404)"**
- Verify the Project ID is correct
- Ensure the token has access to the specified project

**"Missing required configuration"**
- Fill in all required fields: GitLab URL, Project ID, Access Token, Branch

### Deployment Issues

**"git push failed"**
- Verify token has write access to the target branch (Maintainer or higher if protected)
- Confirm the repository allows HTTPS pushes with access tokens (`oauth2` with PAT is supported)

**"No files to deploy"**
- Run WP2Static crawl first to generate static files
- Check that files exist in `wp-content/uploads/wp2static-processed-site/`

### Log Analysis

Check WP2Static logs at **WP2Static ‚Üí Logs** for detailed error messages:

```
GitLab Private deployment started
Found 45 files to deploy
Deploying batch 1 of 3
Successfully deployed 20 files to GitLab
GitLab Private deployment completed
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Type**: Use **Project Access Tokens** instead of Personal Access Tokens when possible for better security isolation.

2. **Access Token Storage**: Tokens are stored in the WordPress database. Consider using environment variables for enhanced security.

3. **Token Permissions**: Use minimal required scopes:
   - Project Access Token: `api` scope only
   - Personal Access Token: `api` and `write_repository` only

4. **Network Security**: Ensure your GitLab instance is accessible over HTTPS.

5. **Token Expiration**: Set reasonable expiration dates and rotate tokens regularly.

## Limitations

- **Server Git Required**: The WordPress environment must have `git` available in `PATH`
- **Deploy Scope**: Deletions (if enabled) are limited to the deploy subdirectory
- **Large Repos**: Shallow clones mitigate cost, but very large histories may still impact performance

## QA Checklist

- Connection test succeeds and shows project path and default branch
- `git --version` available on server; shallow clone succeeds
- Push to target branch works with access token (Maintainer or higher if protected)
- Deploy subdirectory behavior:
  - Delete Orphaned Files OFF: only additions/updates within `public/`
  - Delete Orphaned Files ON: `public/` cleaned before copy; files outside `public/` untouched
- Commit author name/email reflect configured values
- Token is masked in logs and error messages
- No-op deploy logs ‚ÄúNothing to commit‚Äù and push succeeds without error
- CI/CD pipeline triggers on commit and reads from `public/`
